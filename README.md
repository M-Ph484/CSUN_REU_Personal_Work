# CSUN_REU_Personal_Work
progress made with reu project


This is the work done for my portion of the CSUN REU Project 3 - Energy Prediction for Automobile 
Air Conditioning Systems. Data Collection was accomplished using an OBD-II sensor, then the OBD app created CSV files that could be used for modeling.
